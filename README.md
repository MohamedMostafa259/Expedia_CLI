## Introduction
This is a console-based implementation of a simplified Expedia.com site, focusing on itineraries, flights, and hotels. The project is designed with dummy APIs, aiming to provide a basic user interface and functionality for managing travel itineraries.

## Features
### Users
There are two types of users: Admin and Customer. The primary focus of the code is on the Customer part.
### User Interface
The user interface allows customers to create and manage itineraries, select flights, book hotels, and view their total itinerary cost.
### Itineraries
  - Users can create itineraries consisting of flights and hotels.
  - Each itinerary can contain 0 or more flights and hotels. (e.g., 4 flights, 2 hotels).
  - I considered only one-way flights and hotels for the first Minimum Viable Product (MVP), but the system is extensible for adding cars, transits, and more ... .
  - Each itinerary item (e.g., a flight or hotel) has its own cost, which is the sum of all internal items' costs, and information.
  - For simplicity, dummy data is used when convenient.

## Dummy APIs Source
In this project, I make use of dummy APIs provided by [Dr. Mostafa Saad Ibrahim](https://github.com/mostafa-saad). These APIs serve as a simulated data source for flight and hotel information, allowing me to focus on developing and testing my Expedia Console Program without needing real external APIs. He provided us with these them in his great [C++ Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/103GjP3@CpoI0V4YIqdHCuKOMQ2Q7ysCnzVANr9HKR9C0i964WO325Ys0ww_XVQvK4H0L8zmHg==/)
